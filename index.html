[7:29 pm, 13/04/2025] Pulkit: Diagnosis: The build failure is caused by an error related to the inability to find the package.json file at the specified location.

Solution:

Verify that the package.json file exists in your project's root directory and was committed to the repository.
If the package.json file is present, ensure that it is in the correct location and has the appropriate permissions.
Check if there are any issues with the file system or disk that could be preventing the build process from accessing the package.json file.
If everything seems correct, you may need to investigate further by reviewing the npm configuration and environment setup.
By ensuring the presence and correctness of the package.json file in the repository, you should be able to resolve this build failure.
